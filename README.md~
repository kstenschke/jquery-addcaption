#jquery-addcaption 1.0.0

A jQuery plugin that adds a caption to a given image element.
The caption text is grabbed from a specifiable attribute, e.g. the alt-text of the resp. image.
Optionally CSS and style attributes can be transferred from that image to the rendered figure tag.

## Installation

Include script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else):

```html
<script src="/path/to/jquery.addcaption.js"></script>
```

**Do not include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...).** The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked
in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.
